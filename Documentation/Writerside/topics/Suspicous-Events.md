# Suspicous Events

Suspicious events are SoundPerceptionEvents which draw a single search agent away from their patrol route to investigate the location of the sound. The gameplay design for suspicious events are twofold:

1. Distract a search agent from their current path and move to a fixed point for a period of time.
2. Punish players for carelessly making noise while moving through the level.

While investigate a suspicious event, search agents are still actively marking their observed points. This prevents other search agents from converging to the same location. Once enough time has passed without another event, the search agents resume their normal patrol behavio.
